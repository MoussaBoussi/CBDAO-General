# Coin Breeder DAO (CBDAO)

Welcome to the official github repository for CBDAO. CBDAO has been created to serve as a sandbox for users to experiment and proof-test various consensus protocols which help govern DAOs. The initial consensus mechanism put in place will be the ‘Incentivized Governance Protocol’, a model invented by CBDAO which simplifies and combines the solutions of the holographic consensus model on a completely decentralized level.

#
## Why was this sandbox created?

Existing DAO environments are usually limited with pressures arising from regulations and internal/external politics. This makes it (i) slow to implement changes (ii) limited in terms of implementing creative consensus mechanisms which has a tendency to directly affect the overall tokenomics of a DAO’s native token. We believe that a sandbox free of these pressures will help bolster our abilities to research and implement various consensus mechanisms without any imposed limits, in a timely manner.

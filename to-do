Ropsten Test Progress
- whitelist t/f error
- total supply calculation error with burning 
- remove burning_owner function - too centralized
- remove global halt function - too centralized
- confirming if 'user' query function is where users check all active deposits, yield, time, etc.
- staking period needs to be taken care of
- stake rewards need to be taken care of - staking period must be the culprit
- 'active deposits' from the 'users' query function needs to be taken care of! it doesn't update even after withdrawing 
- farm function needs to be separated from user whitelisting
